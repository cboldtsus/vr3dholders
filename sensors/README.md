## How to Insert Sensor Into Holder
When the final model is concieved, detach your Oculus© sensor from stand. Unplug your sensor USB from device. Make sure your cord is long enough to reach the ceiling, if not, purchase a seperate USB extender. Slide USB end through the wide rectangle slot on the oval part of holder (hole is measured for Oculus© sensor USB). When the cord is all the way through, carefully insert sensor stem into circular hole infront of the wide rectangke hole. Thats it !! Now proceed to the next step of hanging it up.

## How to Cling to Ceiling
*!!When you have succesfully inserted sensor into holder!!* This holder is based off of a clip holder for the ceiling rails. Take the square platform with rail slot, slide one side all the way on rail, while the other hangs. Take the hanging side and slip on to other side of rail. It should be hanging now !!
